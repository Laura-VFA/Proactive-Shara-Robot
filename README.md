# Shara Proactive Robot
*THIS IS A SECOND VERSION OF THE [EVA ROBOT](https://github.com/Laura-VFA/Affective-Proactive-EVA-Robot)*.  
Shara is a **social 🗣 and affective ❤️ robot**. It is not only a passive assistant, but an active one: **proactive behaviour** is incorporated in the robot. It can start conversations and show concern about the user, making the interaction more natural and affective.  
This repo contains the *brain* 🧠 structure of the robot, the proactive and interaction behavior themselves.
